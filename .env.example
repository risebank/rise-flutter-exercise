# Copy this file to .env.local for local development (not committed to git)
# Or set these as environment variables in your IDE/terminal

# Environment type (dev/staging/prod)
ENVIRONMENT=dev

# API Configuration
API_BASE_URL=https://your-api-endpoint.execute-api.region.amazonaws.com

# AWS Cognito Configuration

# environment variables are not set. The fallback values are configured for
# the test environment and are safe to use during development.
